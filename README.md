# Python Unit Testing Project

This project contains unit tests for Python functions using the `unittest` framework. The project demonstrates how to test functions by asserting expected results, string lengths, and content.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. `unittest` (comes with Python's standard library)
3. `python-dotenv` (to manage environment variables)

You can install `python-dotenv` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
